# Tic-Tac-Toe

![Demo](Project_demo.gif)

## Overview
The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a simple console-based implementation of the classic 3x3 grid game developed using C++/CLI. The game allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the grid, with the goal of getting three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features
- **Two-Player Mode**: Players take turns to play as X or O.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that players select only empty cells.
- **Win and Draw Detection**: Checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
- **Restart Option**: Allows players to start a new game after completion.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Functions handle grid display, win conditions, and player turns.

## How to Play
1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns entering their moves by selecting an available cell.
3. The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
4. If a player gets three marks in a row, they win; if the grid is full without a winner, the game is a draw.
5. Players can choose to restart the game after it ends.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C++/CLI
- **Development Environment**: Any C++/CLI-compatible IDE (e.g., Visual Studio)
